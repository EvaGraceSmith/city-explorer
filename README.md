## Overview
 This is a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated requests for data from a third-party API.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
I followed the [trello guidelines](https://trello.com/b/Ajj9Cbac/module-2-city-explorer) to build this app.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
#### This application utilizes:
* React
* Bootstrap
* Axios
* Node.js
* Express
* CORS


## Change Log

* 01-25-23- added a search feature, so when a city name is entered,        returns the Latitude and Longitude in a React Card component.
* 01-26-23- Updated the card to also render a map of the city.
* 01-26-23- added an Error Alert feature that appears when an invalid city name is entered. 

* 02-04-23 10:00pm When the user clicks the "Explore!" button, then weather data populates with accurate information.
* 02-05-23- 2:00pm When the user clicks the "Explore!" button, then the top twenty movies set in the area will be displayed in the browser

[env files](https://blog.bitsrc.io/a-gentle-introduction-to-env-files-9ad424cc5ff4?gi=a943229a4181)
"To summarize, .env files contain credentials in key-value format for services used by the program they’re building. They’re meant to be stored locally and not be uploaded to code repositories online for everyone to read. Each developer in a team typically carries one or more .env files for each environment."
