# Project Name

**Author**: Eva Grace Smith
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)
**Netlify** https://sparkling-meringue-6175b2.netlify.app/

## Overview
 This is a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated requests for data from a third-party API.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
I followed the [trello guidelines](https://trello.com/b/Ajj9Cbac/module-2-city-explorer) to build this app.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
#### This application utilizes:
* React
* Bootstrap
* Axios
* Node.js
* Express
* CORS


## Change Log

* 01-25-23- added a search feature, so when a city name is entered,        returns the Latitude and Longitude in a React Card component.
* 01-26-23- Updated the card to also render a map of the city.
* 01-26-23- added an Error Alert feature that appears when an invalid city name is entered. 

* 02-04-23 10:00pm When the user clicks the "Explore!" button, then weather data populates with accurate information.
* 02-05-23- 2:00pm When the user clicks the "Explore!" button. Then the top twenty movies set in the area will be displayed in the browser
* 02-05-23- 5:00pm Modularize the back-end

[env files](https://blog.bitsrc.io/a-gentle-introduction-to-env-files-9ad424cc5ff4?gi=a943229a4181)
"To summarize, .env files contain credentials in key-value format for services used by the program they’re building. They’re meant to be stored locally and not be uploaded to code repositories online for everyone to read. Each developer in a team typically carries one or more .env files for each environment."

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
